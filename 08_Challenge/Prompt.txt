Smart Insurance

Komodo wants to work with smart cars that collect driver data to calculate the costs of car insurance. 

The car tracks all the data for a driver:
- how often they speed or follow the speed limit,
- how often they swerve outside of their lane 
- how often they roll through a stop sign, and 
- how often they follow too closely. 

Write a program that shows premium costs based on a driver's driving habits. Obviously, if a driver has
poor driving skills, their premium will be higher.

Note: This is very open ended and allows you to be creative. A base premium cost can be
an estimated number and a premium is the monthly amount that a driver would pay
